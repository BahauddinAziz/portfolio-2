[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), if you're not familiar, is a forum-based social network where users participate in discussions around specific topics, known as subreddits.

Reddit has been around since 2006 and primarily has users from the US & Canada, with a growing user base in India.

In this blog, I share insights from an experiment I conducted to explore the potential of generating leads and real money on Reddit.

## The Experiment

### Objective
- **Goal**: Determine if it's possible to generate sales and make real money on Reddit.

### Hypothesis
- Reddit users are more active compared to other platforms.
- High-ticket businesses and influential decision-makers are present on Reddit.
- Engaging on Reddit is straightforward and quick, even for newcomers.

### Methodology
I posted similar queries on different subreddits to test these hypotheses:
1. [Post 1: r/SaaS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/192kvdy/do_people_really_get_customers_on_reddit/)
2. [Post 2: r/agency](https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/comments/192ryth/does_anyone_here_generate_leads_from_reddit/)

These posts allowed me to engage with over **50 individuals** through comments and direct messages (DMs).

### Findings: Strategies for Finding Customers

1. **Join Relevant Subreddits**: Focus on subreddits where your or your product's expertise is most applicable.

2. **Engage Actively**: Contribute by answering questions and offering valuable insights.

3. **Build Reputation**: Consistent engagement enhances recognition within the community.

4. **Leverage DMs for Business Opportunities**: As your reputation grows, users may reach out via DMs for solutions, leading to potential business transactions.

### Key Insight: The Value of Adding Value
- The most common success factor cited by those who made money on Reddit was simply adding value.

- Engaging with the right posts and building a reputation over time was crucial.

- Active participation also served as a form of SEO, generating leads from posts commented on years ago.

### Monetary Results
- Earnings ranged from a minimum of $15 (from a subscription to an app) to a maximum of $20,000.

- Major brands are also starting to use Reddit as a customer growth channel.

## Next Steps

- I plan to apply these learnings over the next week and will share the results in a follow-up post.

- Additionally, I'm starting a community for individuals interested in learning about customer acquisition on Reddit.
