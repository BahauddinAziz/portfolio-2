## Introduction

After over 5 years of helping SaaS startups with their tech and sales, plus scrolling through countless startup-related subreddits, I've come to realize that there are a few key questions I find myself repeating often. These aren't just any questions; they are the cornerstone of building and selling your SaaS effectively.

## Key Questions You Should Answer

### 1. **What Problem Does Your Startup Solve?**
   - It might seem obvious, but let's dive deeper:
     - What specific problem are you addressing?
     - Who experiences this problem?
     - How is this problem currently being solved?

### 2. **How Many People Have You Talked to About This Problem?**
   - Getting real feedback is crucial:
     - Engage with a significant number of people facing this problem.
     - It's not about your idea; it's about THE PROBLEM.
     - Sometimes, speaking to as few as 5 people is enough; other times, you might need 20 or more.

### 3. **Current Solutions and Your Competitive Edge**
   - Understanding the existing landscape:
     - How are potential customers currently addressing this issue?
     - How does your solution stand out, beyond just being cheaper or easier to use?


### Steps to Take Before Coding

These insights are vital before you even start writing any code. For many, this realization comes after they've already begun, but it's never too late to refocus.


## Locating Your First Customers

The key question here is, "Where do people who have this problem hang out?" It could be a physical place, a social media platform, an event â€“ anywhere. Understanding this will guide you to your first customers.

### My Current Research

I'm also exploring how startups can effectively find their first customers on platforms like Reddit.


## Conclusion

Finding your first paying and loyal customers hinges on how well you understand and answer these questions. If you've got some thoughts or need guidance, feel free to reach out. Let's find these answers and your customers together!
