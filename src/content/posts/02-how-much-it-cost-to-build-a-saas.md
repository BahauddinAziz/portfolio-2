## Introduction

There's a common misconception about the cost of developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), especially in the tech world. I've seen inflated figures floating around, but let me set the record straight with a more realistic breakdown.

### My Assumptions:

- You have identified a problem worth solving.
- You've validated the problem with real potential customers.
- At least one customer is ready to pay for a solution.
- You have a clear idea of what your MVP should be.

## The Reality of MVP Costs

### For B2C SaaS

Believe it or not, for most B2C SaaS products, a simple WhatsApp group can often serve as an MVP. Cost? Absolutely nothing.

### For B2B Solutions

B2B solutions usually aim to automate or simplify a process. Most apps are straightforward, utilizing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### What's Really Needed?

- A competent full-stack freelancer with a portfolio.
- That's pretty much it.

#### What You Don't Need:

- A designer
- Multiple developers
- Ongoing maintenance

#### A Note on Development Speed

Adding more tech doesn't equate to faster development. I've built an app in 10 days solo, which could have taken a month with a team.

## How to Vet a Tech Freelancer

1. Review their previous work.
2. Test the apps they've built.
3. Ask detailed questions about their work.
4. Share their code on public forums like Reddit for peer review.

## The Bottom Line: Cost

The cost can vary, but it shouldn't exceed $20,000. Hire a good freelancer, have them work full-time on the MVP, and pay them well. You can expect a usable version within a month, after which you can take it to your customers for feedback and final adjustments.

## Conclusion

Building an MVP doesn't have to break the bank. With the right approach and a skilled developer, you can achieve your goals efficiently and cost-effectively.
